# PySide2-Docker
This is a simple Hello World example using Docker with PySide2

I'm still having some issues with these openGL errors, but the GUI works.
If you know how to fix without using an Nvidia based container let me know.
```
libGL error: No matching fbConfigs or visuals found
libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast
```
